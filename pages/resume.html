                I'm a highly motivated software engineer with experience in designing and delivering scalable,
                efficient software
                solutions. Bringing a strong blend of technical expertise and problem-solving skills, I excel at
                understanding complex
                challenges and translating them into reliable, user-friendly applications. Passionate about Agile
                methodologies and
                Scrum practices, I am eager to contribute to collaborative, iterative development processes that enhance
                team
                productivity and product quality. Committed to continuous learning and innovation, I aim to contribute
                effectively to
                your team and help drive your company’s success.

                <h6>Jason Li - manager Ko Shing</h6>
                <p>Kollin has worked with us as a restaurant employee and has consistently shown himself to be reliable,
                    hard-working, and
                    customer-oriented. In a dynamic and sometimes high-pressure environment, he remained calm,
                    professional, and focused on
                    providing excellent service to our guests.
                    <br><br>
                    His responsibilities included taking orders, serving food and drinks, managing the cash register,
                    and ensuring a clean
                    and organized workspace. Kollin quickly adapted to the fast pace of the job and worked efficiently
                    both independently
                    and as part of the team. He was always willing to help colleagues and took initiative when things
                    needed to be done,
                    often without having to be asked.
                    <br><br>
                    One of Kollins greatest strengths is his ability to stay composed and friendly, even during peak
                    hours. He communicates
                    clearly with both guests and colleagues and contributes to a positive atmosphere in the workplace.
                    <br><br>
                    I am confident that the professional attitude, reliability, and work ethic Kollin has shown in the
                    hospitality industry
                    will serve him well in any future position or field of work.

                <h3 class="text-center">Interests</h3>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy staying active and challenging myself physically. I have a background in
                    kickboxing and
                    soccer, and nowadays I regularly go to the gym to maintain my fitness. Besides sports, I’m
                    passionate about creating
                    my own programming projects, which allows me to explore new technologies and improve my coding
                    skills. I also enjoy
                    gaming, as it helps me relax.</p>
