                Hello! I am Kollin Smits, a motivated and curious software engineering student at Windesheim Zwolle.
                Ever since I discovered programming, I've been passionate about creating things that solve real problems
                and make life easier—or simply more fun. I am someone who loves to learn by doing. Whether it is through
                academic projects, personal experiments, or collaborating with others, I am always looking for ways to
                deepen
                my knowledge and improve my skills. I'm especially interested in agile development, with a particular
                focus on Scrum,
                where teamwork, adaptability, and continuous improvement play a big role. Outside of my studies, I enjoy
                working on side
                projects that challenge me to try new technologies and push my creativity. I believe that growth comes
                from stepping out of
                your comfort zone, and I actively seek out opportunities that help me do just that.
                <br><br>
                Thanks for visiting my site. Feel free to reach out if you would like to connect or collaborate!
